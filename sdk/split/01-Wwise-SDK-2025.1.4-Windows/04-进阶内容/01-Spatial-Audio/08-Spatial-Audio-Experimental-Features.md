Spatial Audio Experimental Features

Some Spatial Audio features are marked as [Experimental] in the Wwise SDK Documentation. Remember the following guidelines when using experimental features:

- Experimental features are tested internally and we expect them to be generally stable.
- You can ship games that use experimental features, but ensure that you test thoroughly to avoid any unintended side effects.
- Experimental features are disabled by default.
- Feature behavior might change in a future version of Wwise. If you are using experimental features and need to upgrade Wwise, review the release notes carefully to be aware of any such changes and migration notes.
- Experimental features might be removed entirely in a future version of Wwise.
