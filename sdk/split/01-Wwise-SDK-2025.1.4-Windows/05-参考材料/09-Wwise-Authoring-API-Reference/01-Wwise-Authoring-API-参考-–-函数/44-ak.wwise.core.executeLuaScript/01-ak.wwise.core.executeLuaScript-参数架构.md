ak.wwise.core.executeLuaScript 参数架构

# 架构

{

"type": "object",

"properties": {

"luaScript": {

"type": "string",

"description": "Defines the main Lua file path to load and execute. Use this when your Lua code is stored in a file. Use an absolute file path. When this is used, the directory containing the script is automatically added to the Lua module search path, allowing the script to use \\c require to load additional modules from that directory."

},

"luaString": {

"type": "string",

"description": "Defines the main Lua code to execute as a string. Use this when you want to execute Lua code directly without creating a file, which is useful for simple scripts, dynamic code generation, or inline execution. The code can span multiple lines and can use \\c require to load modules from the configured Lua paths. This parameter is mutually optional with \\c luaScript - you can use either one or both. Note: Unlike \\c luaScript, using \\c luaString does not automatically modify the Lua module search path (\\c package.path). If you need to load modules relative to a specific directory, use \\c luaPaths to explicitly add search paths."

},

"luaPaths": {

"type": "array",

"description": "Defines an array of paths to be used to search additional Lua modules using the \\c require system. Each path should contain a \\c ? placeholder that will be replaced with the module name. Example: \\c 'C:\/path\_to\_folder\/?.lua'. These paths are added to the Lua \\c package.path before the main script or string is executed.\\n Several values provided for the option.",

"items": {

"type": "string",

"description": "A value for the option."

}

},

"requires": {

"type": "array",

"description": "Defines additional modules to be loaded at runtime using the \\c require system. Each module will be loaded before the main script or string is executed. Note that the following folders are automatically added to the Lua module search path: \\c PROJECT\/Add-ons\/Lua, \\c APPDATA\/Audiokinetic\/Wwise\/Add-ons\/Lua, \\c INSTALLDIR\/Authoring\/Data\/Add-ons\/Lua. You can place custom modules in these directories and reference them here by name.\\n Several values provided for the option.",

"items": {

"type": "string",

"description": "A value for the option."

}

},

"doFiles": {

"type": "array",

"description": "Defines additional Lua files or directories to load before the main Lua script or string is executed. If a file path is provided, that specific file will be executed. If a directory path is provided, all \\c .lua files in that directory and its subdirectories will be loaded recursively. This is useful for loading helper functions, configuration, or setup code that the main script depends on.\\n Several values provided for the option.",

"type": "string",
