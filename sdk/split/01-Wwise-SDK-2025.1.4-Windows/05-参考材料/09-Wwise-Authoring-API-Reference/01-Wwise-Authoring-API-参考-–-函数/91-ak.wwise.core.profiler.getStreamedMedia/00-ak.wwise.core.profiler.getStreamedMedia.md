ak.wwise.core.profiler.getStreamedMedia

Retrieves the streaming media at a specific profiler capture time. This data can also be found in the Advanced Profiler, under the Streams tab. To ensure the Streams data is received, see [ak.wwise.core.profiler.enableProfilerData](ak_wwise_core_profiler_enableprofilerdata.html).

# Arguments

| 名称 | 类型 | 说明 |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **time** \* |  | Time in milliseconds to query for media, or a Time Cursor from which to acquire the time. User Time Cursor 可由用户操控，Capture Time Cursor 代表当前捕获的最新时间。  One of: |
| integer | 范围：[0,\*] |
| string | 识别其中一种全局性能分析器光标。可能的值：  - user - capture |

# Result

| 名称 | 类型 | 说明 |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **return** \* | array | Array of Streams. |
| return **[...]** | object | Information about how each of the streams is managed by the Wwise sound engine. |
| return[...].**deviceName** \* | string | The name of the device from which the stream eminates. |
| return[...].**streamName** \* | string | The name given to the stream. |
| return[...].**fileSize** \* | integer | The size of the file being streamed. |
| return[...].**filePosition** \* | number | The position of the stream within the file, given as a percentage. |
| return[...].**priority** \* | integer | The priority of the stream. |
| return[...].**bandwidthTotal** \* | integer | The rate at which the file was streamed in the last profiling frame. This value takes all transfers into account, including transfers that occurred from the Stream Manager's cache |
| return[...].**bandwidthLowLevel** \* | integer | The rate at which the file was streamed in the last profiling frame. Unlike the Total Bandwidth field, this field value considers transfers that occurred from within the low-level device. |
| return[...].**referencedMemory** \* | integer | The amount of memory that is referenced by the stream. This excludes memory used for I/O transfers. It can be seen as a measure of how much data the stream may grant to the sound engine at any given time. |
| return[...].**estimatedThroughput** \* | integer | The estimated throughput of the stream. The sound engine estimates the rate at which it consumes data from a stream according to its encoding format and number of channels. |
| return[...].**active** \* | boolean | Indicates True if the stream was active at least once during the last profiling frame. |
| return[...].**targetBufferSize** \* | integer | The streaming device's target buffer length. |
| return[...].**bufferStatusBuffered** \* | number | The portion of requested data that is buffered, given as a percentage of the target buffer size. |
