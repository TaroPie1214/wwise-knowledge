重要的迁移说明 (2011.3)

When migrating from 2011.2.X or before to 2011.3 or later:

- The LFE management has been enhanced. LFE separate control was removed and is now considered as a normal channel like all others. From now on, the LFE volume is now entirely bound to the Generic Volume property. Separate control of the LFE will now be possible using the Wwise Gain Effect. All controls driving the LFE will be lost during the migration.

That change will fix a large number of known issues and is making the volume behavior more easily predictable for all users.
