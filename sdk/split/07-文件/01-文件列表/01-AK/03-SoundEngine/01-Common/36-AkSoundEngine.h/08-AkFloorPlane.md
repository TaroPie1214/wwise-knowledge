AkFloorPlane is used in to orient the Game Object 3D Viewer in Wwise, and in the transformation of geometry instances in Wwise Spatial Audio.   | 枚举值 | | | --- | --- | | AkFloorPlane\_XZ | The floor is oriented along the ZX-plane. The front vector points towards +Z, the up vector towards +Y, and the side vector towards +X. | | AkFloorPlane\_XY | The floor is oriented along the XY-plane. The front vector points towards +X, the up vector towards +Z, and the side vector towards +Y. | | AkFloorPlane\_YZ | The floor is oriented along the YZ-plane. The front vector points towards +Y, the up vector towards +X, and the side vector towards +Z. | | AkFloorPlane\_Last | End of enum, invalid value. | | AkFloorPlane\_Default | The Wwise default floor plane is ZX. |   在文件 [AkSoundEngine.h](_ak_sound_engine_8h_source.html) 第 [127](_ak_sound_engine_8h_source.html#l00127) 行定义. |
