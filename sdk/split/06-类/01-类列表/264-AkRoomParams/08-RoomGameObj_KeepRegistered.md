If set to false, Spatial Audio registers the room object only when it is needed by the sound propagation system for the purposes of reverb, and unregisters the game object when all reverb tails are finished. We recommend that you set RoomGameObj\_KeepRegistered to true if you use RTPCs on the room game object, if you call `SetScalingFactor()`, or call `PostEvent()` for the purpose of ambience or room tones.   |  |  | | --- | --- | |  | **备注:** The room game object can be accessed through the ID that is passed to `SetRoom()` and the `AkRoomID::AsGameObjectID()` method. Posting an event on the room game object uses automatic room game object placement by Spatial Audio so that when the listener is inside the room, the sound comes from all around the listener, and when the listener is outside the room, the sound comes from the portal(s). Typically, this would be used for surround ambience beds or room tones. For point source sounds, use separate game objects that are registered as Spatial Audio emitters. 参见  - [AkRoomParams::RoomGameObj\_AuxSendLevelToSelf](struct_ak_room_params_a07f3e05103b351f449673dfff361aa71.html#a07f3e05103b351f449673dfff361aa71) - [AkRoomID](struct_ak_room_i_d.html) |   在文件 [AkSpatialAudioTypes.h](_ak_spatial_audio_types_8h_source.html) 第 [749](_ak_spatial_audio_types_8h_source.html#l00749) 行定义. |
