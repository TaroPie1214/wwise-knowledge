The added translator can either override previously added translator, or attach them to itself. In the case overridePreviousTranslator is true, the responsibility of deleting all the translator previously attached to the m\_currentMessageTranslator will fall back to the class that created them. Also, the given translator can override all previous translator(s) except the DefaultErrorMessageTranslator, which will always be attached to the given translator.  参数  |  |  |  | | --- | --- | --- | | [in] | in\_errorMessageTranslator | The new translator that should be used by the error handler | | [in] | in\_overridePreviousTranslator | Whether or not the given translator should override previously set translator(s) | |
