Any known (non-anonymous) combination of configurations will work. For example, ambisonics will be decoded or encoded if needed.   |  |  | | --- | --- | |  | **备注:** The function will fail if the input or output configuration is object-based, as the speaker volume matrix would be undefined. |   All panning or spatialization types are honored. 3D Spatialization is performed relative to the default listener position (0,0,0) and orientation, where the front vector is (0,0,1) and the top vector is (0,1,0), left handed.  返回  AK\_Success if succeeded, AK\_InvalidParameter if the input or output configuration is object-based, or AK\_Fail if the channel configurations are unknown or unhandled.  参数  |  |  | | --- | --- | | in\_posData | Positioning data. The field "threeD" is ignored if in\_posData.behavioral.spatMode is AK\_SpatializationMode\_None. | | in\_inputConfig | Channel configuration of the input. | | in\_outputConfig | Channel configuration of the output. | | out\_mxVolumes | Returned volumes matrix.
