The curve's data is copied into an opaque data structure, pointed to by out\_curve. The curve's data remain until the client of this service calls AK::IAkPluginServiceAttenuationCurve::Delete.  返回  True if the copy succeeded, or if the requested curve was not initialized.  参数  |  |  | | --- | --- | | in\_pAllocator | Memory allocator. | | in\_object | The audio object from which to extract the curve. | | in\_curveTypesMask | The set of curves, identified with a mask of bits offset by AkAttenuationCurveType values, to extract from the set of Attenuation curves. For example, set to (1 << AttenuationCurveID\_VolumeDry | 1 << AttenuationCurveID\_Spread) to obtain the distance-driven dry volume and spread curves. | | out\_curves | The returned addresses of the requested curve data. Pass in an array of void\* with length corresponding to the number of desired curves. For each curve, if it exists, a blob of data is allocated by the function and the address is returned in the corresponding item of the out\_curves. The item is set to nullptr if the curve does not exist. | |
