Only an out-of-place plugin is allowed to change the channel configuration. Object processors may receive a channel configuration with type "object" if attached to a bus configured for Audio Objects processing, but otherwise may receive a config for just 1 source. Out-of-place object processors may change the format type, in which case the host bus will automatically create an output object with the desired channel configuration. | |
