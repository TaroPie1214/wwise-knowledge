NULL if the channel configuration of the device is not object-based or does not have a passthrough. | | io\_objects | 3D Audio objects and object audio buffers to be consumed. The audio buffers are in the native format of the sound engine (typically float, deinterleaved), as specified by io\_rFormat passed to [Init()](class_a_k_1_1_i_ak_audio_device_effect_plugin_ac2b7ed06052a176e4445b743e7b3dfe7.html#ac2b7ed06052a176e4445b743e7b3dfe7). It is up to the plugin to transform it into a format that is compatible with its output. | | io\_gain | Volume gain to apply to all inputs. If the effect applies the gain, it must reset the gain to 1.0f so that it's not applied a second time in the sink plug-in. | |
