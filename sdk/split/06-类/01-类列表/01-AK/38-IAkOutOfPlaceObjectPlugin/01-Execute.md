In that case it must use [AK::IAkEffectPluginContext::GetOutputObjects](class_a_k_1_1_i_ak_effect_plugin_context_ad0b9c549569b25dea349d2a352f02e58.html#ad0b9c549569b25dea349d2a352f02e58). Arguments in\_pObjectBuffersOut and in\_pObjectsOut can only be safely used if the plugin creates objects during Init, either via [AK::IAkEffectPluginContext::CreateOutputObjects](class_a_k_1_1_i_ak_effect_plugin_context_a96f65eb02b520f2ca5af497e645971a0.html#a96f65eb02b520f2ca5af497e645971a0), or by setting the channelConfig field of io\_rFormat to a normal channel configuration (i.e. whose eConfigType is not AK\_ChannelConfigType\_Objects). |   参见  [AK::IAkEffectPlugin::Init](class_a_k_1_1_i_ak_effect_plugin_ae5a44837c4adddf6ff58fab57453b020.html#ae5a44837c4adddf6ff58fab57453b020).  参数  |  |  | | --- | --- | | in\_objects | Input objects and object audio buffers. | | out\_objects | Output objects and object audio buffers. | |
