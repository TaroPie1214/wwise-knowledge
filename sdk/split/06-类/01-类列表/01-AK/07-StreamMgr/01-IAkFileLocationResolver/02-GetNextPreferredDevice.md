If your File Resolver only handles one device, return AK\_NotImplemented and the [StreamMgr](namespace_a_k_1_1_stream_mgr.html "Audiokinetic Stream Manager's implementation-specific interfaces of the Low-Level IO submodule.") will use the only device configured. If it handles multiple devices, you can base the decision on where to get the file on any kind of heuristic: file extension, file name, access rights, CodecID, etc. The order in which devices are searched is left to the implementer. This function will always be called first with io\_idDevice = AK\_INVALID\_DEVICE\_ID.  返回  - AK\_Success if there is a device to delegate the [Open()](namespace_a_k_1_1_sound_engine_1_1_dynamic_sequence_ab6daddd96e109dc7669889733ce4f2cc.html#ab6daddd96e109dc7669889733ce4f2cc) call to. io\_idDevice should be set to the proper AkDeviceID (as returned by [AK::StreamMgr::CreateDevice](namespace_a_k_1_1_stream_mgr_a64a22d377d25137222fbb66ff21965d5.html#a64a22d377d25137222fbb66ff21965d5)). - AK\_FileNotFound if all devices have been exhausted. - AK\_NotImplemented if there is only one device in the system and file resolution is trivial.  备注  This can be called from multiple threads.  参数  |  |  | | --- | --- | | in\_FileOpen | File name and flags passed to the Open call. | | io\_idDevice | In: last device used.
