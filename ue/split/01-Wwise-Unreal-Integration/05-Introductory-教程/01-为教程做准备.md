为教程做准备

These tutorials require the default installations of Wwise and Unreal 5. Although there are no tutorial-specific supplementary materials available, the Integration Demo Wwise sample project contains a variety of sounds and music that you can use for most of the examples. The Integration Demo is included with the Wwise SDK, which you can add to your installation through the Audiokinetic Launcher. For details, see [Integration Demo Sample](https://www.audiokinetic.com/library/edge/?source=SDK&id=soundengine_integration_samplecode.html).

# 前提要求

Before you begin the tutorials, review the following prerequisites and ensure that all necessary setup is complete:

- In Unreal, create a project with the Third Person game template, with a **C++** Project Default. The Wwise Unreal Integration does not support Blueprint-only projects because the Wwise Integration plug-in is fully written in C++ and must be compiled. 若不小心创建了纯 Blueprint 型工程或要使用现有纯 Blueprint 型工程，则可通过向其添加 C++ 类来将其转换为 C++ 工程。For more information on Unreal projects, see [Creating a New Project](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/unreal-engine/creating-a-new-project-in-unreal-engine) and [Third Person Template](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/unreal-engine/third-person-template-in-unreal-engine).
- Install the Wwise Unreal plug-in as described in [安装](installation.html) and [构建插件](building.html).
- Enable Auto-Defined SoundBanks in your Wwise project. See [Automatically Defining SoundBanks](https://www.audiokinetic.com/library/edge/?source=Help&id=auto_defining_soundbank) for more information.

# Required Unreal Knowledge

Before you begin to integrate audio in Unreal, we strongly recommend that you have a working knowledge of Unreal 5 game development. Review the following sections in the Unreal documentation in particular:

- [Level Editor](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/unreal-engine/level-editor-in-unreal-engine): The Level Editor is the initial layout that appears when you open Unreal. You use it to manage your assets: place sounds in the level, create new sounds, and so on. It is also the view from which you open other views, such as the Blueprint Editor.
- [Actors and Geometry](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/unreal-engine/actors-and-geometry-in-unreal-engine), [Components](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/unreal-engine/components-in-unreal-engine), and [Blueprints Visual Scripting Overview](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/unreal-engine/overview-of-blueprints-visual-scripting-in-unreal-engine): In Unreal, every object in your level is an Actor. There are different types of Actor, and Actors can have components that define what they do. For example, an Actor can have a Mesh that you can use as a Trigger to define areas in which a certain ambience plays. You can use Blueprints to design systems, and add them to Actors as well. Within these systems, you can reference your Actor’s components so that, for example, an ambience starts to play when something enters your Trigger area.

|  | **TIP：** When you generate SoundBanks, a notification appears and plays a sound. Depending on the level of your own sound integration, the sound might be quite loud, but you can disable it. To do so, go to **Edit** > **Editor Preferences**. Under Level Editor, click **Miscellaneous** and clear **Enable Editor Sounds**. |
