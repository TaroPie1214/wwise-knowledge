## 设置用户偏好

### Resetting confirmation messages

Wwise prompts you for confirmation before performing actions that cannot be undone.
While working in Wwise, you can disable some of these confirmation messages by clicking
**Don't ask again**. You can later undo this by resetting
confirmation messages in the User Preferences.

**To reset confirmation messages:**

1. From the menu bar, click **Project > User Preferences**
   (Shift+U).
2. In the **Confirmation Messages** group of the User
   Preferences dialog, click **Reset**.
3. In the confirmation dialog, click **OK**.

### Managing external editors for audio

In Wwise, you can edit audio files in the external editor of your choice. 请参阅 [“在外部编辑器中编辑音频文件”一节](../../03-设置工程/05-管理工程中的媒体文件/07-在外部编辑器中编辑音频文件.md "在外部编辑器中编辑音频文件")。

**To manage external editors:**

1. From the menu bar, click **Project > User
   Preferences** (Shift+U). External editors are listed in a table in the User
   Preferences dialog. See [“使用表格”一节](../03-Wwise-界面基础知识/00-Wwise-界面基础知识.md#using_tables "使用表格") for details.
2. In the **External Editors** group, click **Add**.
3. In the Open dialog, browse to and select an audio editing program then click
   **Open**.
4. You can now optionally change a selected editor's file path by clicking ![](../../../../images/btn_browse_icon.png), or delete it by clicking **Delete**.
5. Optionally change the **Start Mode**. The default,
   Single Process, is recommended for most editors.

   - **Single Process**: For each edit request, Wwise
     starts a single process and passes the list of files to edit as arguments to the
     process.
   - **Multiple Processes**: For each edit request,
     Wwise passes one file to edit as the argument of each process. Select this for audio
     editors that do not accept multiple files as arguments.
6. If you have more than one external editor, the first listed is the default. To
   change the default, select an editor and click **Set As
   Default**. In most views in Wwise, the keyboard shortcut Ctrl+E opens the
   selected file or files in the default editor.
7. Click **OK** to save your settings and close the
   dialog.

### Setting the Wwise user interface font and scaling

**To set the font and scaling:**

1. From the menu bar, click **Project > User Preferences**
   (Shift+U).
2. In the **User Interface - Font and Scaling** group of
   the User Preferences dialog, optionally set:

   - **Font**: The font used in the Wwise user
     interface. A preview is rendered immediately.
   - **Font Size**: The change is visible after clicking
     **OK**.
   - **Enable High DPI**: By default, Wwise is optimized
     for display on a 4K or 5K monitor. For lower DPI monitors, you can disable this. The
     change takes effect after restarting Wwise.
3. Click **OK** to save your settings and close the
   dialog.

   (Shift+U).
2. In the **Similarity Search** group of the User
   Preferences dialog, select **Enable Similar Sound Search in Media

   dialog.

### Restoring the legacy Property Editor

In Wwise 2024.1, the Property Editor was redesigned and moved from the Primary Editor to
the right side of the Object Tab. This option restores the pre-Wwise 2024.1 version of the
Property Editor alongside the later version.

**To restore the legacy Property Editor:**

1. From the menu bar, click **Project > User Preferences**
   (Shift+U).
2. In the **Property Editor** group of the User
   Preferences dialog, select **Add Legacy Property Editor to Primary
   Editors**.
3. Click **OK** to save your settings and close the
   dialog.

### Configuring the Wwise Authoring API (WAAPI)

**To configure the Wwise Authoring API (WAAPI):**

1. From the menu bar, click **Project > User Preferences**
   (Shift+U).
2. In the **Wwise Authoring API (WAAPI)** group of the
   User Preferences dialog, set the following:

   - **Enable Wwise Authoring API**: Opens the
     connection for the Wwise Authoring API, according to the following settings.
   - **Allow connections from**: Comma-separated list of IP addresses (IPv4 or IPv6) that are considered valid. For example, if you have a local server running on localhost, the address would be 127.0.0.1. Wwise 会阻止来自任何其他 IP 地址的传入连接。Default: 127.0.0.1,::1

     The field also supports the metacharacter \*. This allows connections from any IP
     address. It is not secure, and is not recommended.
   - **Allow browser connections from**: Comma-separated list of origins (http://host:port) that are considered valid (HTTP header Origin). 例如，若所用本地服务器在端口 8081 上运行，则源端口为 http://localhost:8081。Wwise 会阻止来自任何其他源端口的传入连接。Use this with care because it is the only protection against cross-scripting attacks.

     The field also supports the metacharacter \*. This allows connections from any IP
     address. It is not secure, and is not recommended.
   - **WAMP port**: WAMP port used by the Wwise
     Authoring API server. Default: 8080.
   - **HTTP port**: HTTP port used by the Wwise
     Authoring API server. Default: 8090.
   - **WAMP max clients**: Maximum number of concurrent
     clients that can connect to the Wwise Authoring API server through WAMP. Default:
     5.
   - **HTTP max clients**: Maximum number of concurrent
     clients that can connect to the Wwise Authoring API server through HTTP POST.
     Default: 2.
3. Click **OK** to save your settings and close the
   dialog.

### Setting the MIDI middle-C mapping

MIDI notes are mapped on a fixed numerical range of 0 - 127. The MIDI specification
defines the note number 60 as middle-C and all other notes are relative to this. There is a
discrepancy that occurs between various models of MIDI devices and software programs
concerning which octave of C is considered middle-C.

**To specify which octave of C is considered middle-C:**

1. From the menu bar, click **Project > User Preferences**
   (Shift+U).
2. In the **MIDI** group of the User Preferences dialog,
   choose a value for **Display Middle C As**:

   - **C3**: MIDI note range is C-2 to G8
   - **C4**: MIDI note range is C-1 to G9
   - **C5**: MIDI note range is C0 to G10
3. Click **OK** to save your settings and close the
   dialog.

### Configuring Live Media Transfer

This sets the maximum memory that can be used by Live Media Transfer, which can occur if you are [“Editing while profiling a game”一节](../../07-完善工程/06-性能分析/08-Editing-while-profiling-a-game.md "Editing while profiling a game"). 新添加的和修改后的媒体不会替换磁盘上或游戏数据包中的文件；它会驻留在内存中，直至游戏终止。在此过程中，只会传输在 Wwise 工程中添加或修改且游戏正在使用的媒体。

When the limit is reached, an error is logged in the [“Advanced Profiler”一节](../../09-参考主题/06-Profiler-视图/03-Advanced-Profiler/00-Advanced-Profiler.md "Advanced Profiler").

You can track the amount of memory used by Live Media Transfer in the **Loaded Media** tab of the [“Capture Log”一节](../../09-参考主题/06-Profiler-视图/01-Capture-Log/00-Capture-Log.md "Capture Log"). 在 SoundBank Name（音频包名称）列中，会为基于此功能传输的媒体添加 From Authoring（来自设计工具）标记。

The amount of memory used by Live Media Transfer is also included in the **Used** value in the **Memory** tab of
the Advanced Profiler and in the **Total Used Memory** in the
[“Performance Monitor”一节](../../07-完善工程/06-性能分析/02-探索游戏性能分析视图.md#exploring_game_profiling_views_performance_monitor "Performance Monitor"). This contribution is
temporary and the amount of memory used by the packaged game will be lower.

**To configure Live Media Transfer:**

1. From the menu bar, click **Project > User Preferences**
   (Shift+U).
2. In the **Live Media Transfer** group of the User
   Preferences dialog, set the **Max memory for Media updates
   (MB)**. Default: 2000.
3. Click **OK** to save your settings and close the
   dialog.
