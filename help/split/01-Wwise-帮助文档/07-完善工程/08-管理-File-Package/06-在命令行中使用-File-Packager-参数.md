## 在命令行中使用 File Packager 参数

使用命令行生成文件包时，须用特定参数来定义文件包的特征。The following table lists the arguments that you can use.

| 参数 | 描述 |
| --- | --- |
| `-generate` | 启动文件包生成过程，You can combine this argument with the File Packager project path or with the `-info` argument. 示例如下：  - Generate with a File Packager project:  `-generate {project_path}` - Generate a single package with a `SoundbanksInfo.xml` file:  `-generate -info {soundbank_info_filename} -output {package_name}` - Generate a stream package and a bank package with a `SoundbanksInfo.xml`   file:  `-generate -info {soundbank_info_filename} -output_stm {package_name}   -output_bnk {package_name}` |
| `-info {filename}` | Specifies the location of the `SoundbanksInfo.xml` file.  Use with one or multiple of the following:  `-output`  `-put_` |
| `-output {filename}` | 生成一个包含 SoundBank 和流文件的文件包，`{filename}` specifies the package name and location in which to save the generated file package.  You can use this argument when the `{projectpath}` is not specified. It can be either a full file path or the package name. 但都要求包含文件包扩展名。  You can combine this argument with `-output_stm` or `-output_bnk` to generate more than one package file, where each contains a different set of files.  If you explicitly define the `-output` argument, it takes precedence over the value specified in the project. |
| `-output_stm {filename}` | Generates one file package that includes only streamed media files. `{filename}` specifies the package name and location in which to save the generated file package.  You can use this argument when the `{projectpath}` is not specified. It can be either a full file path or the package name. 但都要求包含文件包扩展名。  You can combine this argument with `-output` or `-output_bnk` to generate more than one package file, where each contains a different set of files. |
| `-output_bnk {filename}` | Generates one file package that include only SoundBank files.`{filename}` specifies the package name and location in which to save the generated file package.  You can use this argument when the `{projectpath}` is not specified. It can be either a full file path or the package name. 但都要求包含文件包扩展名。  You can combine this argument with `-output` or `-output_stm` to generate more than one package file, where each contains a different set of files. |
| `-output_loose {directory}`  `-output_loose` | Generates one or multiple file packages that include only loose media files. These files are referenced by Events or structures in at least one SoundBank, but are not included in any SoundBank in the project. `{directory}` is optional and specifies the location in which to save the generated file packages. If `{directory}` is not specified, the packages are generated in the same directory that contains the `SoundbanksInfo.xml` file.  You can use this argument when the `{projectpath}` is not specified. It can be either a relative or absolute directory.  You can combine this argument with `-output`, `-output_stm`, or `-output_bnk` to generate more than one package file, where each contains a different set of files. |
| `-blocksize {number}` | 文件包内数据对齐的字节数，The number depends on the requirements of the platform and your project's I/O hook.  If not specified, a value of `1` is used, which indicates no alignment. |
| `-hideprogressui {boolean}` | 指定在 Wwise 内生成文件包时是否显示 Generating Packages 对话框。  如果设置为 True，则进度对话框将不会显示。默认情况下，此参数为 False。 |
| `{projectpath}` | Specifies a File Packager project path that contains a `WFPPROJ` file. When used with the `-generate` argument, other arguments are ignored and the File Packager project is used to generate the packages.  此参数为可选参数。 |
| `-soundbanks_dir {directory}` | Overrides the information in the `SoundbanksInfo.xml` file (at `SoundBanksInfo/RootPaths/SourceFilesRoot`) that specifies the directory in which the generated SoundBanks were saved by Wwise.  此参数为可选参数。 |
| `-cache_dir {directory}` | Overrides the information in the `SoundbanksInfo.xml` file (at `SoundBanksInfo/RootPaths/SourceFilesRoot`) that specifies the directory in which the generated SoundBanks were saved by Wwise.  This is normally written as `projectpath\.cache\platform\`  此参数为可选参数。 |
| `-languages "{language1} {languageN}"` | Space-separated list that specifies the languages to package. Use double quotation marks to enclose the list in a single argument.  Use the keyword `"SFX"` in the language list to package SFX files as well.  此参数为可选参数。默认情况下会打包所有语言。  仅在未指定 File Packager 工程时才会使用此参数。 |
| `-banks "{soundbank1} {soundbankN}"` | Space-separated list that specifies the SoundBanks to package. Do not include the `.bnk` extensions. Use double quotation marks to enclose the list in a single argument.  此参数为可选参数。默认情况下会打包所有SoundBank。  You can use this argument when the File Packager project is specified: it automatically builds the packages that have references to the specified SoundBanks. |
| `-includedFilesInBanks "{soundbank1} {soundbankN}"` | Space-separated list of SoundBanks that include media files that you want to package as loose media. Do not include the `.bnk` extensions. Use double quotation marks to enclose the list in a single argument.  You can use this option if the `PrepareEvent` API needs loose media, and banks loaded in memory also need the same media.  此参数为可选参数。默认情况下，SoundBank 中的媒体文件不会作为零散文件添加到文件包中。 |
| `-excludedFilesInBanks "{soundbank1} {soundbankN}"` | Space-separated list of SoundBanks that include references to media files that you want to package as loose files. Do not include the `.bnk` extensions. Use double quotation marks to enclose the list in a single argument.  You can use this options if the `PrepareEvent` API needs loose media, and different SoundBanks loaded in memory also need the same media.  此参数为可选参数。By default, media files that are referenced but not included in a SoundBank are added to the package only if they are not referenced in any other SoundBank. |
| `-verbosity {level}` | Specifies how much information is printed in the tool's standard output and error streams.  Set the level to `0` (errors only), `1` (errors and warnings), or `2` (errors, warnings, and information messages).  |  |  | | --- | --- | | [备注] | 备注 | | 消息显示操作可能会减慢大型工程的打包过程。If the tool runs slowly, reduce the verbosity level to improve performance. |  此参数为可选参数。By default, all message types are printed (level `2`). |
