### 对文件包内的文件排序

Files assigned to packages are not organized in any particular order. However, in some
cases you might want certain files to be close to one another to minimize disk
seeking during the game. You can arrange the files within a package with the File
Order Editor.

**为文件包中的文件排序的方法如下：**

1. 执行以下操作之一：

   - 双击 Packages 列表中的文件包。
   - 从 Packages 列表中选择一个文件包并点击 **Edit file order**（编辑文件顺序）。

   File Order Editor 将打开。
2. 执行以下操作之一：

   - In the Package files pane, select the files that you want to reorder and click
     **Add to ordered list**.
   - Drag files from the Packages list pane to the File order
     pane.

   The files are added to the list in the File order pane.
3. (Optional) To reorder a file in the list, drag it to the desired position. A horizontal
   line indicates the insertion point.
4. Continue to rearrange the files until you have created a final order for the files within
   the package.

   All remaining files are automatically added to the ordered list through
   the "Remaining files inserted here" placeholder.
