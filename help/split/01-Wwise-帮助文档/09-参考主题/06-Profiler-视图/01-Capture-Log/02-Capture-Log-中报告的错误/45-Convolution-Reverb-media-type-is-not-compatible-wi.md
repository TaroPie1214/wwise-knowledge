#### Convolution Reverb media type is not compatible with plug-in. Soundbanks may need to be re-generated due to plug-in version differences, or were generated for the wrong platform.

“Convolution Reverb 媒体类型与插件不兼容。因为插件版本不同或为错误的平台生成了音频包，所以可能需要重新生成音频包。”若使用了之前的 Wwise 版本生成 Impulse Response（冲激响应）或为别的平台生成了 Impulse Response，则将出现此错误。

**推荐的解决步骤：**

- Regenerate SoundBanks.
