# Capture Log 中报告的错误

[Wwise 帮助文档](../../../../00-Wwise-帮助文档.md) > [参考主题](../../../00-参考主题.md) > [Profiler 视图](../../00-Profiler-视图.md) > [Capture Log](../00-Capture-Log.md) > Capture Log 中报告的错误

### Capture Log 中报告的错误

下面列出了在使用 Wwise 执行游戏性能分析时， Capture Log（捕获日志）中可能报告的所有错误。若其中未列出您所遇到的错误，请联系 Audiokinetic 技术支持部门或[提交 Bug Report](https://www.audiokinetic.com/library/wwise_launcher/?source=InstallGuide&id=reporting_bugs)。

在联系技术支持部门时，如能清楚地描述重现步骤，将可以大大加快调查流程。另外，强烈建议在重现问题时记录性能分析会话。有关更多详细信息，请参阅。

Using the Project Zipper, which is accessible from the wrench icon on the Projects page of the Audiokinetic Launcher, zip your project files and send them with your profiling session.

Capture Log 中报告的大多数错误与之前的通知关系密切。若要查找这些通知，请选择错误行并顺着左侧互连圆点找到所选实例相关的全部消息。一般情况下，通过查看之前的消息可以更好地了解错误发生的环境。
