## HDR category

The HDR category contains HDR (high dynamic range) properties of the selected object. HDR
audio is a technique to design a mix using level values spanning a very high dynamic
range as occurs in nature. HDR is also a run-time system that dynamically maps this wide
range of levels to a range that is more suited to your sound system's output. The HDR
category is where you define the HDR behavior and properties for the selected bus or, in
a more limited fashion, audio structure.
