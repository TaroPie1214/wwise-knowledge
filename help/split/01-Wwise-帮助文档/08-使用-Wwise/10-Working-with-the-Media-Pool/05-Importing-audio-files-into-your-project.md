## Importing audio files into your project

You can import audio files using the [Audio File Importer](https://www.audiokinetic.com/library/edge/?source=Help&id=audio_file_importer) or by dragging them directly into the Containers
hierarchy.

When you import files directly into the Containers hierarchy, you have the option of
importing them as one of the following object types if the target Container allows it:

- Sound SFX（音效声）
- Sound Voice（语音声）
- Music Segment （音乐段落）
- Audio Source
- Music Track （音乐轨）
